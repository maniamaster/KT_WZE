\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In goal of this experiment is the determination the  of the branching ratio of the $W$ boson
BR($W\rightarrow\mu\nu$). First, $W$ and $Z$ bosons are reconstructed using
data provided by the Tevatron collider at Fermilab. By comparing with Monte Carlo
simulations, selection parameters are obtained, which allow for clean cuts for
filtering out background events (jets and cosmic source). The mass and the
transverse mass is then determined for the $Z$ and $W$ boson respectively.
Finally the branching ratio is calculated from the number of selected events,
the trigger efficiencies, as well as the reconstruction efficiencies.


\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}
\subsection{Electroweak interaction}
The GWS theory (Glashow, Weinberg, Salam) is the unified description of both
the electromagnetic force mediated by the photon and the weak interaction
mediated by the massive $W^+,W^-$ and the neutral neutral $Z$ boson. It was
confirmed experimentally in the 1970s \cite{wikigsw}. 
The gauge bosons are introduced by means of a local SU(2)$_L$ gauge symmetry in
a weak isospin space. The weak isospin doublets are formed by fermions
differing by one unit of charge \cite[p.;416]{thomson}. By also replacing the
U(1) symmetry by a new U(1)$_Y$ symmetry with the ``hypercharge'' $Y$, the
neutral $Z$ boson can be identified by a linear combination of the neutral
$W^{(3)}$ boson and the $B$ boson coupling to the hypercharge. More details can
be found in \cite[p.\;418ff]{thomson}.
Being a charged boson,
the $W$ bosons couple to fermions differing by one unit of charge. Furthermore
it maximally violates parity as it only couples to left-handed particles and
right-handed antiparticles. The vertex factor is given by \cite[p.;409]{thomson}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:vertexw}
    -i\frac{g_W}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{1}{2}\gamma^\mu(1-\gamma^5),
\end{align} where $g_W$ is the weak coupling constant and $\gamma^\mu$ are the
gamma matrices. The $Z$ boson however, couples to any pair of identical
fermions, albeit coupling more strongly to left handed ones. This becomes
apparent in the form of the vertex factor: \cite[p.\;432]{thomson}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:vertexz}
    -i\frac{1}{2}g_Z \gamma^\mu(c_V-c_A\gamma^5),
\end{align}
with the vector and axial vector couplings $c_V$ and $c_A$.

\subsection{Matrix elements and Decay rates}
The matrix elements for the electroweak interaction can be calculated with the
appropriate Feynman rules.
After averaging over the three possible polarizations, the spin-averaged matrix
element squares is obtained for both the $W$ and the $Z$ boson decaying to a
lepton and its neutrino or a lepton- anti-lepton pair, respectively
\cite[p.;242,411]{thomson}:
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:spinavg}
    \braket{|\mathcal{M}_W^2|}&=\frac{1}{3}g_W^2m_W^2\\
    \braket{|\mathcal{M}_Z^2|}&=\frac{1}{3}(c_V^2+c_A^2)g_Z^2m_Z^2.
\end{align}
These can be inserted into the decay rate formula: \cite[p.\;411]{thomson}
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:decayrate}
    \Gamma=\frac{p^*}{32\pi^2m^2}\int
    \braket{|\mathcal{M}^2|}\d\Omega=\frac{p^*}{8\pi m^2}
    \braket{|\mathcal{M}^2|},
\end{align}
where $m$ is the mass of the boson and $p*$ is the momentum of the lepton in
the center of mass frame.
One can argue that $p*=m_Z/2$, as the
decay happens in the centre of mass frame of the decaying particle.
Therefore the decay rate is 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:decay}
    \Gamma(W^-\rightarrow e^- \bar{\nu}_e)&=\frac{g_W^2m_W}{48\pi}.\\
    \Gamma(Z\rightarrow e^- e^+)&=\frac{g_Z^2m_Z}{48\pi}(c_V^2+c_A^2).
\end{align}
Lepton universality tells us that this is the same for all three leptonic
channels when neglecting masses. For hadronic processes, the CKM matrix has to
be considered, while excluding the top quark, as it is too massive.
For the $W$ boson, one obtains for the decay width [cite]
\begin{align}
\Gamma_W=(3+6 \kappa)\Gamma(W^-\rightarrow e^-
\bar\nu_e)\approx9.2\;\frac{g_W^2m_W}{48\pi}=2.1\;\text{GeV.}
    \label{eq:gammaw}
\end{align}
$\kappa\approx1.038$ is a correction factor that accounts for second order QCD processes.
Similarly, for the $Z$ boson, one obtains
\begin{align}
    \Gamma_Z\approx2.5\;\text{GeV.}    \label{eq:gammaZ}
\end{align}
The branching ratios for the muon channel are therefore
\begin{align}
    BR(W\rightarrow\mu\bar\nu_\mu)&=10.8\%,\\
    BR(Z\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-)&=3.5\%.
    \label{eq:branches}
\end{align}
\subsection{Invariant and transverse mass}
For the $Z$ boson one can calculate the functional form of the invariant mass
peak by taking into account its finite lifetime.
The cross section for a $q\bar q\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ event is proportional
to [cite]
\begin{align}
    \sigma\propto|\mathcal{M}|^2\propto\left|\frac{1}{q^2-m_Z^2+im_Z\Gamma_Z}\right|^2=\frac{1}{(q^2-m_Z^2)^2+m_Z^2\Gamma_Z^2},
    \label{eq:breit}
\end{align}which is a Breit-Wigner curve.
$q$ is the invariant mass of both muons. As both can be detected in such an
event, the Breit-Wigner-curve can be fitted directly to the selected data to
obtain the mass of the $Z$ boson.
For the $W$ boson, things are more complicated. Due to the $W$ events only
having one muon, the undetectable neutrino has to be reconstructed frm the
missing momentum. For a hadronic collider such as the tevatron, the total
centre of mass energy cannot be known on an event to event basis [cite] due to
the composite nature of the hadrons. More specifically, the $z$-momentum of the
interacting partons are unknown, making the invariant mass reconstruction
impossible. However, one can define the transverse mass $M_T$, which can be
calculated from the reconstructed transverse momentum of the neutrino
$\vec{p}_T^\mu$. First, the missing transverse energy $MET$ is determined as
\begin{align}
    MET\approx|\bold{p}_T^\nu=|-\bold{p}_T^\mu-\bold{u}_T,
    \label{eq:met}
\end{align}where $\vec{u}_T$ is the transverse momentum of the hadrons [cite].
The transverse mass is then defined as
\begin{align}
    M_T=\sqrt{(MET+\bold{p}_T^\mu)^2-(MET_x+p_x^\mu)^2-(MET_y+p_y^\mu)^2}.
    \label{eq:mt}
\end{align}
This quantity is lorantz invariant but does not peak at $M_Z$. However, the $W$
mass can be read off from the position of the dropoff, as the longitudinal
component of the invariant mass is then close to zero [cite].


\section{Experimental setup and methods}
\label{sec:setup}
For this experiment, 2 types of data have been provided: The first is a subset
of real data from the D\O\;detector at Fermilab near Chicago. The second are two
sets of simulated monte-carlo W and Z events generated by PYTHIA [cite].\\
At the D\o detector, muons are identified  both in the muon detector and the
tracking system. Whereas the tracking system directly surrounds the interaction
point and allows for gauging the muon's momentum and direction precisely, thje
outer muon detector is mostly used to match the track in the tracking system.
This is possible because muons are the only particles capable of reaching the
muon detector, due to a combination of their relatively long lifetime and small calorimeter
energy deposition. [cite?] For more details on the D\O\;  detector see
\cite{d0}.
As the sheer amount of data from the collider is too much to analyse and save,
both software and hardware triggers are used to decide, whether an event is
worth investigating. The data that is provided is pre-filtered for at least one
muon in every event that has a transverse momentum of at least 15\;GeV/c. [???
zusätzlicher trigger] The monte-carlo data has been reconstructed, such that the
events look like real data. Therefore the monte-carlo serves a benchmark for
the analysis of the real data.
To obtain invariant mass peaks for the $Z$- aswell as the transverse mass peak
for the $W$ boson, the right events have to be selected out of the ~3 million
events provided. This happens by first fixing a set of object level cuts, which
define what is counted as a muon. These cuts are the same for both $W$- and $Z$ boson analysis
. Secondly, a range of object level cuts have to be performed to single
out the right events for $Z$ and $W$ production respectively. These have to be
physically motivated by keeping in mind what is expected for the muons in a
$W$ or $Z$ decay and should also be compared to the monte-carlo simulation. By
first comparing various muon parameters for the simulated data and the uncut
experimental data, one can define appropriate cuts in these parameters that cut
out most events not present in the simulation while also keeping events that do
resemble the simulation mostly intact. Finally the real data is plotted with
these cuts performed and compared with the simulated results. This process is
repeated until a satisfactory isolation of $Z$ or $W$ events has been produced.
All of the analysis is done with ROOT.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
\subsection{Selection of $Z \rightarrow \mu\mu$ events}
The $Z$ boson mass distribution for the simulated monte-carlo data is shown in
\cref{fig:zmcmass}.
\begin{figure}
    \subfigure[]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig/zmc_uncut_zmass.pdf}
        \label{fig:zmcmass}
    }
    \subfigure[]{
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{fig/data_uncut_zmass.pdf}
        \label{fig:uncutZmass}
    }
    \caption{$Z$ mass plotted for both monte-carlo (left) and real data (right)
    without any cuts. One can clearly see the expected mass peak at the monte
    carlo case, aswell as a leage number of events with very low mass, while in
    the real data plot, no mass peak is visible yet. For the monte-carlo case,
    a $\chi^2$ fit is performed with the Breit-Wigner curve.}
\end{figure}
One can clearly see the mass peak of the Z boson. A large number of events,
however, is also situated at the beginning of the mass spectrum. A fit
performed by root with the function \ref{eq:breit}
\begin{align}
    \sigma\propto\frac{1}{(q^2-m_Z^2)^2+m_Z^2\Gamma_Z^2}
    \label{eq:breit}
\end{align}
is perfeormed, with the parameters $p_0$ as a constant proportionality factor,
$p_1$ being $m_Z$ and $p_2$ being the decay width $\Gamma$. The results are
summarized together with all other fits in \cref{tab:fits}.
Apart from the large number of events at low mass, this clearly resembles the
expected $Z$ mass peak. In \cref{fig:uncutZmass}, the uncut real data is
plotted. From the ~2 million events, almost all of them give a very small $Z$
mass and the peak is not visible. Note that the trigger
``TRIG\_MUW\_W\_L2M3\_TRK10'' \cite{fprakt} is still included in the uncut case.
Additional object level cuts are performed, which are summarized in
\cref{tab:objectcuts}. These are identical for both $Z$ and $W$ boson analysis
as they will effectively cancel out when calculating the efficiencies.
The accepted and rejected events for both $Z$ monte-carlo and real data are
shown in \cref{app:z} (\cref{fig:pt,fig:chi,fig:ehalo}).
To further separate background events, event level cuts are performed. Firstly,
events where only one muon are detected are rejected, as in a $Z$ decay, two
muons are expected. Secondly, both muons should have different charge due to
conservation of charge. Two muons with same charge indicate either two seperate
processes both creating a positively / negatively charged muon or a cosmic
event in which one cosmic muon crosses both detectors.

    \label{tab:objectcuts}
\end{table}

\subsection{Cosmics}
The cosmic-ray background stems from high energy cosmic particles entering the
earth's atmosphere, where they decay into jets of particles. Muons are also
created this way. Because of time dilation, they can reach the earth's surface
before they decay, leading to the cosmic background in the detector [cite].
In order to identify cosmic events, both timing and angular seperation are
taken into account. First, it is expected that timing differences from muons
originating from $Z$ decays have a negligible time difference at both muon
detectors, since the $Z$ boson can be treated as stationary in the lab frame.
Cosmic muons, however, should be detected at one side of the detector first and
at a later time on the other side, since they need to travel the distance of
the detector first. The timing difference for $Z$ monte-carlo and real data is
plotted in \cref{fig:timing}. A maximal time difference of $\Delta t=10$\;ns
was chosen as cut condition. However, also the simulated data shows two peaks
at around $100$\;ns.
Next, a two-dimensional histogram is plotted with the angular seperation
$\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\phi$ as parameters. $\eta$ is the pseudorapidity of the
track and gives a measure of the tilt from the beam axis, while $\phi$  is the
angle around the beam axis. The result is shown for the simulation and real
data in \cref{fig:angle}. Note that so far, no angular cuts have been performed
at all. Still, with the cuts given above, there is a clear preference for
$\Delta\phi=\pi$ for both simulation and real data. This is desired, as this
means that the $Z$ boson upon its decay is quasi-stationary and therefore both
muons produced in the decay travel in opposite directions, as expected from
momentum conservation. Therefore, a decision was made not to perform any more
cuts containing angular information. As will be seen below, the cuts performed
thus-far give a very satisfactory result for the reconstructed $Z$ mass peak.
The reason for this will be discussed in \cref{sec:discussion}.

    $\Delta\eta$ and difference between azimuthal angle $\Delta\phi$ of both muons
    for simulated (a) and real data (b). The upper plots are the accepted
    events, the lower plots are the rejected events. With the cuts detailed
    above, there is a clear preference of $\Delta\phi=\pi$ in both simulation
    and real data. Also, lower pseudorapidity difference $\Delta\eta$ is more
    common. For the uncut case, both simulation and real data shows additional
    structure at non-$2\pi$ azimuthal difference. Note that no angular cuts
    have been performed in either case.}
   \label{fig:angle}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Zmass}
The invariant $Z$ mass can be calculated directly with ROOT with the
TLorentz-vector class. In theory, the muon mass is not needed for a
reconstruction of the $Z$ events, as $E\approx p$ holds for the
ultrarelativistic case, which is fullfilled for the muons in question. Finally, with the cuts performed, the $Z$ mass is plotted in
\cref{fig:zmass1,fig:zmass2} for both $Z$ monte-carlo and real data.
One now clearly observes the expected mass peak also in the real data. The
rejected events mostly consist of low-$Z$-mass events and cut out very little
from the actual mass peak, which is especially apparent in the simulated data.
Again, a fit is performed for the Breit-Wigner curve \cref{eq:breit}. The
results are summarized in \cref{tab:fits}.

\begin{table}

    events, as can be seen by comparison of simulation and data. A

    events.}
